# Contributing to seedling

This project is a hobby project of @jpkrohling and @yuriolisa. You are welcome to try it out, but things are a bit too rough at the moment. If you insist on contributing, we probably won't say no, especially if you want to contribute with a bug fix.

At the moment, there are no rules. What we expect to introduce as rules in the future:

- tests will be required for every new change
- PRs titles will follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
