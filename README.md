Seedling is a web-based tool for building custom OTel Collector builds.

## Features

This is still an early experiment, but here's what we have in mind for this project:

* List of components, such receivers, processors, connectors, exporters, and extensions, coming from different sources
* Ability to select the components and have a manifest created for it
* Ability to create a distribution based on an OTel Collector configuration file
